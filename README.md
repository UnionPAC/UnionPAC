  <h1>🏂 Geoff Jamieson</h1> 

  <h3 >Front-end developer from Hamilton, ON 🇨🇦</h3>

  <p>I got into coding because I was the web designer for a company I founded called Koji Street. While working with a development team to bring the idea to life, I became interested in the coding aspect of things and began building small projects for fun on the side. After I left Koji Street, I decided to make a full time switch to pursue a career in web development.</p>

  🔭 I’m currently building my own JavaScript framework called <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/kumos'>**Kumos**</a>
 
 🌱 I’m currently learning **TypeScript**

💬 Feel free to ask me about **CSS, JavaScript, React... or anything [here](https://github.com/UnionPAC/UnionPAC/issues)**

✨ When I'm not coding I like being outdoors, hiking, backpacking, rock climbing, reading and playing Gloomhaven
